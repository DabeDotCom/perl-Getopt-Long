Module Getopt::Long - extended processing of command line options
=================================================================

Note that this source tree contains a Makefile.PL (for Perl) and a
GNUmakefile (for development).

Relevant targets of the GNUmakefile are

* test : runs the standard tests

* regtest : runs the extended regression tests

* tardist : creates a new tar.gz distribution

Note that a Github release is a snapshot of this repository. An
official CPAN release should be made with the 'tardist' target of the
GNUmakefile.
