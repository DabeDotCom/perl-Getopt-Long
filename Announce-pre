Version 2.26_01 of module Getopt::Long has been released to CPAN.
It is a prerelease of version 2.27.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).
It adds a lot of features like automatic abbreviation of option names,
aliases and callback functions.

The README document is attached to this message.
