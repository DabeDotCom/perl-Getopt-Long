Version 2.26_01 of module Getopt::Long has been released to CPAN.
It is a prerelease of version 2.27.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).
It adds a lot of features like automatic abbreviation of option names,
aliases and callback functions.

The README document is attached to this message.

The easiest way to get it is by using the CPAN shell:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install("JV/Getopt-Long-2.26_01.tar.gz")'

Alternatively, use a Web browser and point it to the CPAN search engine:
  http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Getopt::Long

Changes in this version
-----------------------

* Fix several problems with internal and external use of 'die' and
  signal handlers.

* A callback routine that is associated with a hash-valued option will
  now have both the hask key and the value passed. It used to get only
  the value passed.

* Eliminated the use of autoloading. Autoloading kept generating
  problems during development, and when using perlcc.

* Redesigned the regression tests.
